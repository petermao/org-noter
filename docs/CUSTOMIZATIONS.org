* Customizations
  Out of respect for the existing user base of =org-noter=, almost all of the
  user-interface features of this fork remain the same those of as the original
  =org-noter=.  However, users may be interested in our variations on the theme
  of Gon√ßalos Santos.

** Peter's mods
   In order of frequency, I use precise notes the most, standard notes next and
   no-questions notes the least, so I have bound keys to reflect those
   preferences with =i= for precise notes, =TAB= for standard notes; for
   no-questions (no-prompt) notes, =I= is for precise notes and =M-i= for
   standard notes.:
   #+begin_src elisp
     (with-eval-after-load 'org-noter
       (define-key org-noter-doc-mode-map (kbd "i")   'org-noter-insert-precise-note)
       (define-key org-noter-doc-mode-map (kbd "C-i") 'org-noter-insert-note)
       (define-key org-noter-doc-mode-map (kbd "I")   'org-noter-insert-precise-note-toggle-no-questions)
       (define-key org-noter-doc-mode-map (kbd "M-i") 'org-noter-insert-note-toggle-no-questions))
   #+end_src

   For navigation, I use =..-sync-..-note= more than =..-sync-..-page-..=, so I
   bound the =note= commands to the easier-to-type =M-[p.n]= bindings and the
   less-used =page-..= commands to the harder-to-type =C-M-[p.n]= bindings.
   #+begin_src elisp
     (with-eval-after-load 'org-noter
       (define-key org-noter-doc-mode-map (kbd "M-p") 'org-noter-sync-prev-note)

   In the original code, the tooltip arrow on PDFs is *Orange-Red on White*,
   which works fine when the arrow is always on the left side of the page.  I
   found that with the 2D precise notes introduced by Ahmed Shariff, I sometime
   had trouble locating the arrow as I navigated through my notes.  The *Black
   on Cyan* color-scheme that I use is more jarring, hence easier to locate.
   #+begin_src elisp
     (with-eval-after-load 'org-noter
       (setq org-noter-arrow-background-color "cyan"
       org-noter-arrow-foreground-color "black"))

*** Customizing note opening process

By default org-noter likes to store the notes in =Notes.org= file.

Say you want to change that to be dynamically generated, perhaps with =completing-read= of some sort.

Override the =org-noter-create-session-from-document-hook=. The hook will call a function of two arguments, =ARG= and =DOC-PATH=.

=arg= is not used, and =DOC-PATH= is the complete file path to the pdf (document).

This terminates the normal org-noter flow. At this point, org-roam integration generates a new notes file, creates an org-noter heading and reinvokes =(org-noter)=.

See the =org-noter--create-session-from-document-file-supporting-org-roam= in [org-noter-org-roam.el](https://github.com/org-noter/org-noter/blob/master/modules/org-noter-org-roam.el#L45).


*** Customizing the content of precise notes


When I take precise notes, I like the idea of having the content of the highlight stored below the fold of a heading.

This allows me to paraphrase the headline while preserving the original content in the =QUOTE= block.

This is achieved with an advise:

#+begin_src elisp

    (define-advice org-noter--insert-heading (:after (level title &optional newlines-number location) add-full-body-quote)
    "Advice for org-noter--insert-heading.

    When inserting a precise note insert the text of the note in the body as an org mode QUOTE block.

    =org-noter-max-short-length= should be set to a large value to short circuit the normal behavior:
    =(setq org-noter-max-short-length 80000)="

    ;; this tells us it's a precise note that's being invoked.
    (if (consp location)
        (insert (format "#+BEGIN_QUOTE\n%s\n#+END_QUOTE" title))))

** Lamprinos' mods (user)
   @chatziiola prefers "notes.org" as his default notes name, vs the default
   default notes name "Notes.org".  He also chooses to change the default
   ~org-noter-notes-search-path~ from ~~/Documents~ to something else.

In plain ~straight.el~ syntax
#+begin_src elisp
  (straight-use-package 'org-noter)
  (setq org-noter-notes-search-path        '("~/your/path/to/notes"))
  (setq org-noter-default-notes-file-names '("notes.org"))
#+end_src

*** straight.el + use-package
For all those that use ~straight.el~ along with ~use-package~
#+begin_src elisp
  (straight-use-package 'use-package)
  (setq straight-use-package-by-default t)

  (use-package org-noter
               :config
               (setq org-noter-notes-search-path        '("~/your/path/to/notes"))
               (setq org-noter-default-notes-file-names '("notes.org"))
               ;; Include this only next block only if you use ~evil~ with ~general~
               :general
               (general-nmap
                :keymaps '(org-noter-mode-map pdf-view-mode-map)
                "I" 'org-noter-insert-note-toggle-no-questions
                "i" 'org-noter-insert-note))
