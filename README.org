* ORG-NOTER (fork of a fork)
** This is a fork of the *c1-g* fork with some commits picked from *dmitrym*
   - In essence, this is close to the original *weirdNox* (Gonçalo Santos)
     version that you find on MELPA with the refactoring that *c1-g* implemented

   - djvu and epub support have also been advanced by *c1-g*, but I have not
     tested any of that code.

   - The main new feature for PDF users is 2-D precise notes, which can be
     inserted in two ways:
     1. "Select-precise": selecting text in the pdf, followed by =M-i=.  *c1-g*
        changed the position format to use the entire list returned by =edges=.
        This breaks the other way of inserting precise notes.  On *dmitrym*'s
        fork, select-precise notes auto-fill the note title with the selected
        text.  This has deleterious side effects for other note insertion methods.
     2. "Click-precise": =M-i=, followed by clicking a location on the page.
        The location recorded by =org-noter= is typically inaccurate in the
        horizontal direction.  This is something I want to fix.


   - Standard notes can also be inserted in two ways:
     1. "TAB".  Hitting tab creates a note title "Notes for page ##", where the
        page number is inserted automatically over the octothorpes.
     2. "i".  The fundamental =org-noter-insert-note=.  User types note title
        into the minibuffer.

** Note insertion desired features (WIP)
   1. The position of the precise note should be at the click (with a
      configurable horizontal offset) or at the upper-left of the selected text
      (or configurable to one of the corners or ends of the selected area).
   2. Highlighting of selected text should be a user settable configuration option
   3. For any of the note insertion methods, if there is any selected text, then
      it should be the default title.  (or there should be a configurable
      switch)
   4. Add property and/or configuration to make the arrow left or right
      pointing.

** Note logic map/table
   1. Is there an existing note for the page (from =i= or =TAB=)?  Presently,
      this doesn't matter.  "Existing note" implementation is =selection= (#4
      below).
   2. Is there =selected-text=? (is it more than three lines? (=quote-p=))
   3. Is the insertion command
      a. =M-i=
      b. =i=
      c. =TAB= (in which case 3 is always false)
   4. Has the user supplied a =title= for the "Note:" prompt?
      does the title match a prior note title (=selection=)? then add
      =selected-text= to note with =title == selection=


   So (a prioi) we have 8 + 8 + 4 possibilites, but prior notes don't seem to
   always matter, and there are short and long text selections:

   A posteriori, I find that there are 6 + 5 + 4 possibilities, 8 of which I
   would alter:

** design notes

*** =collection= in =org-noter-insert-note= is an alist.  would a hash be better?

*** what is org-noter--view-info-notes? (C-h o)
    org-noter--view-info-notes is a Lisp closure in ‘org-noter-core.el’.

    (org-noter--view-info-notes CL-X)

    Access slot "notes" of ‘org-noter--view-info’ struct CL-X.

      This function has a compiler macro ‘org-noter--view-info-notes--cmacro’.
      This function does not change global state, including the match data.


** Bugs to fix
   1. Navigation of nested notes is spotty. =C-M-p= and =C-M-.= have trouble
      detecting nested notes.
