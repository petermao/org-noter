* ORG-NOTER (fork of a fork)
** This is a fork of the *c1-g* fork with some commits picked from *dmitrym*
   - In essence, this is close to the original *weirdNox* (Gonçalo Santos)
     version that you find on MELPA with the refactoring that *c1-g* implemented

   - djvu and epub support have also been advanced by *c1-g*, but I have not
     tested any of that code.

   - The main new feature for PDF users is 2-D precise notes, which can be
     inserted in two ways:
     1. "Select-precise": selecting text in the pdf, followed by =M-i=.  *c1-g*
        changed the position format to use the entire list returned by =edges=.
        This breaks the other way of inserting precise notes.  On *dmitrym*'s
        fork, select-precise notes auto-fill the note title with the selected
        text.  This has deleterious side effects for other note insertion methods.
     2. "Click-precise": =M-i=, followed by clicking a location on the page.
        The location recorded by =org-noter= is typically inaccurate in the
        horizontal direction.  This is something I want to fix.


   - Standard notes can also be inserted in two ways:
     1. "TAB".  Hitting tab creates a note title "Notes for page ##", where the
        page number is inserted automatically over the octothorpes.
     2. "i".  The fundamental =org-noter-insert-note=.  User types note title
        into the minibuffer.

* /ATTENTION/
  Beyond this point, this document is meant to be read in Org-mode not in a web
  browser.  If it is somewhat useful on a web browser, that is by accident.
** Note insertion desired features (WIP)
   1. The position of the precise note should be at the click (with a
      configurable horizontal offset) or at the upper-left of the selected text
      (or configurable to one of the corners or ends of the selected area).
   2. Highlighting of selected text should be a user settable configuration option
   3. For any of the note insertion methods, if there is any selected text, then
      it should be the default title.  (or there should be a configurable
      switch)
   4. Add property and/or configuration to make the arrow left or right
      pointing.

** design notes

*** =collection= in =org-noter-insert-note= is an alist.  would a hash be better?

*** what is org-noter--view-info-notes? (C-h o)
    org-noter--view-info-X pulls value of X out of a view-info object

      Access slot ~reference-for-insertion~ of =org-noter--view-info= struct CL-X.

      This function has a compiler macro ‘org-noter--view-info-reference-for-insertion--cmacro’.
      This function does not change global state, including the match data.
** pseudo code

   - =selected= \in {N:nil, S:short (<= 80 chars), L:long}.  T = S|L
   - =ins-mode= \in {G:page, P:precise, N:no-questions}      b = not P (G|N), T = G|P
   - =title=    \in {N:nil, W:new, E:existing}
     =ins-mode == no-questions= \rightarrow =title == nil= or existing
   - for =ins-mode == b=, default title is "Notes for page #"
   - for precise note, default title is "Notes for page (# y-pos . x-pos)"
   - Guiding principles for table below
     1. The preferred title is the one the user enters in the minibuffer.
     2. Selected text should be used in the note, either as the title or in the body
     3. Refrain from making notes in the same location with the same title
     4. Precise notes generally have different locations, always make new
        precise notes

** Bugs to fix
   1. Navigation of nested notes is spotty. =C-M-p= and =C-M-.= have trouble
      detecting nested notes.
** Note logic map/table see [[pseudo code]] for a more coherent table
   1. [tTF] Is there =selected-text=? (is it more than three lines? (=quote-p=))
   2. [abc] Is the insertion command
      a. =M-i=
      b. =i=
      c. =TAB= (in which case 3 is always false)
   3. [tTF] Has the user supplied a =title= for the "Note:" prompt?
      does the title match a prior note title (=selection=)? then add
      =selected-text= to note with =title == selection=
